@par Example Description

Configuration of GPIO and USART peripherals to receive characters 
from an HyperTerminal (PC) in Asynchronous mode using an interrupt. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

USART Peripheral is configured in asynchronous mode (115200 bauds, 8 data bit, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity).
No HW flow control is used.
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI.
USART RX Not Empty interrupt is enabled.
Virtual Com port feature of STLINK could be used for UART communication between board and PC.

Example execution:
When character is received on USART Rx line, a RXNE interrupt occurs.
USART IRQ Handler routine is then checking received character value.
On a specific value ('S' or 's'), LED4 is turned On.
Received character is echoed on Tx line.
On press on User push-button, LED4 is turned Off.
In case of errors, LED4 is blinking.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G070xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G070RB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - NUCLEO-G070RB Set-up
    In order to select use of Virtual Com port feature of STLINK for connection between NUCLEO-G070RB and PC,
    User has to set USE_VCP_CONNECTION define to 1 in main.h file.
    If so, please ensure that USART communication between the target MCU and ST-LINK MCU is properly enabled 
    on HW board in order to support Virtual Com Port (Default HW SB configuration allows use of VCP)

    If VCP is not used (USE_VCP_CONNECTION define set to 0 in main.h file), Connect USART1 TX/RX 
    to respectively RX and TX pins of PC UART (could be done through a USB to UART adapter) :
    - Connect STM32 MCU board USART1 TX pin (GPIO PA.09 connected to pin 21 of CN10 connector)
      to PC COM port RX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board USART1 RX pin (GPIO PA.10 connected to pin 33 of CN10 connector)
      to PC COM port TX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board GND to PC COM port GND signal
    
  - Launch serial communication SW on PC (as HyperTerminal or TeraTerm) with proper configuration 
    (115200 bauds, 8 bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity, no HW flow control). 
    Port should be selected according to USE_VCP_CONNECTION value.

  - Launch the program. Enter characters on PC communication SW side.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
